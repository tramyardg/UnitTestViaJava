# Review SOEN 345

- __legacy code__ is simply code without tests.
- __unit test__ is a test that runs in less than 1/10th of a second and is small enough to help you localize problems when it fails.
- __test-driven development__ is a development process that consists of writing failing test cases and satisfying them one at a time. As you do this, you refactor to keep the code as simple as possible. Code developed using TDD has test coverage, by default.
